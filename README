the monome-rgb repository contains a few things for now:

- an old design of a 2x4 button test.  this board was never produced, and may be
  removed in the future.
- an eagle library containing parts (described later)
- arduino firmware to run the test board as a shield
- the eagle files for the 4 button, 2 knob test board (arduino shield)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

the test board's firmware interfaces with a custom version of libmonome (and in
turn, serialosc) that can be found at http://github.com/soundcyst/libmonome


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

eagle library containing:
- rgb led (mouser part 743-HT-358FCH)
- greyscale keypad footprint with rgb led

the keypad footprint contains connector pads for the switch facing outward,
as you might expect by looking at it, while the connector pads for the leds
act more like vias.  connect to them on the bottom layer, or an internal
layer, since there's no escaping the switch trace.

you'll probably also want the Sparkfun library if you want to hack on this
without making your own parts.
