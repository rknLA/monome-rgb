eagle library containing:
- rgb led (mouser part 743-HT-358FCH)
- greyscale keypad footprint with rgb led

the keypad footprint contains connector pads for the switch facing outward,
as you might expect by looking at it, while the connector pads for the leds
act more like vias.  connect to them on the bottom layer, or an internal
layer, since there's no escaping the switch trace.
